At Stackify we receive a lot of data from your apps to our Retrace APIs. We queue all of that data as soon as it gets to us and then we use separate background services to process the data. Message queues help a lot with ensuring data is never lost, traffic spikes, etc. We decided we to put together a list of why you should be using message queues!
