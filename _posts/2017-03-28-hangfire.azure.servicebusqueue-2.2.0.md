A recommended upgrade for all users to improve the reliability and accuracy of the service bus integration:

* Messages will be kept alive during processing to avoid MessageLockLostException when processing takes longer than the queue's LockDuration
* Fix job counts when deadlettered messages exist on queue

This release also adds a number of integration tests for the monitoring and queue implementations for a better development experience.
