<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-hangfire-pro" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Hangfire Pro?</h3>

<p>Hangfire Pro is an extension which adds a few nice features to Hangfire.  Hangfire is open source and free for all to use but unfortunately it takes a lot of my time to maintain and support.  Hangfire Pro is a way for you to purchase really useful functionality while also ensuring Hangfire will be supported for years to come.</p>

<a name="user-content-is-there-a-trial-version" class="anchor" href="#is-there-a-trial-version" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is there a trial version?</h3>

<p>There's no free trial but I do offer a 14 day period with full refund if Pro does not work for you.</p>

<p>I'm sure you're awesome but I prefer to keep things fair and simple: everyone pays the same price.  No discounts, no payment plans.</p>

<a name="user-content-what-happens-if-my-subscription-lapses" class="anchor" href="#what-happens-if-my-subscription-lapses" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What happens if my subscription lapses?</h3>

<p>You lose access to the gem server and priority support.  You won't get any more updates or bug fixes and 'bundle install' won't work anymore.  You retain the right to run the version you have.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-can-you-transfer-a-license" class="anchor" href="#can-you-transfer-a-license" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can you transfer a license?</h3>

<p>Licenses are <strong>not</strong> transferrable to another company.  I will transfer the license from a user-specific email to a group email address (e.g. john_smith@example.com &rarr; tech@example.com) but only for <strong>the same domain</strong>.  It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address.</p>

<p>Every organization that runs Hangfire Pro for their own benefit must purchase a license.</p>

<a name="user-content-what-is-the-buying-process" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-buying-process" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the buying process?</h3>

<p>Click the <em>Buy Now</em> button and put in your info.  Your license will be associated with the email address you use.  I'll generate your download URL and email it to you within 24 hours.</p>

<p>You'll receive a confirmation email upon purchase which can be used as an invoice/receipt.</p>

<p>Just open a Hangfire issue.</p>

<a name="user-content-can-i-get-a-refund" class="anchor" href="#can-i-get-a-refund" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can I get a refund?</h3>

<p>Yes, up to two weeks after purchase.  Let me know the reason and maybe I can help but either way it's not a problem.  Email <a href="mailto:support@hangfire.io">support@hangfire.io</a>.</p>
